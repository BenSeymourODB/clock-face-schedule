# clock-face-schedule

An analog clock dial whose outer band carries one coloured arc per calendar event in the
current 12-hour period — implemented as a **Google Apps Script web app** against a single
Google Calendar.

12 o'clock is the start of the period (midnight or noon); 720 minutes map to 360°. Each arc
carries the event's emoji and a curved title. Overlapping events stack onto concentric inner
rings. Titles too long for their arc are promoted to a floating label outside the dial with a
connector line back to the arc.

## Why Apps Script

The two prior versions of this interface each needed infrastructure the display itself did not
justify:

| Project | Stack | Calendar access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`next-digital-wall-calendar`](https://github.com/BenSeymourODB/next-digital-wall-calendar) | Next.js 16 / React 19 | NextAuth + Google OAuth, server-side refresh tokens, PostgreSQL |
| [`yuvomi-kiosk`](https://github.com/BenSeymourODB/yuvomi-kiosk) | SvelteKit static PWA | Yuvomi REST API, kiosk token provisioning |

Apps Script removes that layer entirely: `CalendarApp` reads the owner's calendar under the
script's own authorisation, and `HtmlService` serves the page from Google's infrastructure. No
host, no OAuth client, no token storage, no database.

The trade is a constrained runtime — no ES modules server-side, client code inlined into HTML,
and a `google.script.run` bridge in place of ordinary HTTP. See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md).

## Status

Planning. Nothing is implemented yet.

## Relationship to the prior implementations

This is a **third implementation, not a fork**. It reuses the part that is worth reusing:
roughly 550 LOC of framework-free TypeScript — arc geometry, 12-hour period maths, emoji and
colour parsing, curved-title fitting, ring stacking — which `yuvomi-kiosk` already extracted
from React into plain modules with tests (yuvomi-kiosk#48, commit `ff18a19`). That layer lifts
across essentially verbatim.

The rendering layer does not lift. NDWC's ~860 LOC of TSX becomes plain functions that build
SVG DOM nodes, which is less work here than in the Svelte port: no component framework, no
reactivity model, and no component test harness to stand up first.
